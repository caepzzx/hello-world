===========================================
Hi,everyone!
  I am a graduate student in Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics.I am researhing something about ultrashort pulse coherent beam combination.Moreover, I will use matlab for my simulation,and I'd like to try to use github to publish my m-file.In fact,I am not proficient in matlab programming and how to use github,but I will try my best to learn.I believe community will  give me many useful help and I'd like to discuss any question with anyone.
  Thanks for your attention!And best wishes for you.
